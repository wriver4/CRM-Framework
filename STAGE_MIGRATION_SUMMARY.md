# Stage System Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the CRM system from string-based stages to a numeric stage system with 10-unit increments. This provides better scalability and allows for future stage insertions without disrupting the existing order.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- **SQL Script**: `scripts/stage_migration_complete.sql`
- Converted `stage` column from `varchar(20)` to `int(11)`
- Migrated all existing data to new numbering system
- Updated both `leads` and `leads_extras` tables

### 2. Stage Numbering System
**New Stage Numbers (10-unit increments):**
- 10: Lead (was 1)
- 20: Pre-Qualification (was 2)
- 30: Qualified (was 3)
- 40: Referral (was 4)
- 50: Prospect (was 5)
- 60: Prelim Design (was 6)
- 70: Manufacturing Estimate (was 7)
- 80: Contractor Estimate (was 8)
- 90: Completed Estimate (was 9)
- 100: Prospect Response (was 10)
- 110: Closing Conference (was 11)
- 120: Potential Client Response (was 12)
- **130: Closed Won (was 14) - MOVED BEFORE CONTRACTING**
- **140: Closed Lost (was 15) - MOVED BEFORE CONTRACTING**
- **150: Contracting (was 13) - MOVED AFTER WON/LOST**

### 3. Code Updates

#### Core Classes Updated:
- **`classes/Models/Leads.php`**:
  - Updated stage validation to use new numbering system
  - Fixed dashboard calculations for Closed Won/Lost (130/140)
  - Updated `get_stage_display_name()` and `get_stage_badge_class()` methods

- **`scripts/stage_remapping.php`**:
  - Complete stage mapping system
  - Badge classes for each stage
  - Module filtering logic
  - Trigger stage identification

#### Language Files Updated:
- **`public_html/admin/languages/en.php`**:
  - Added new stage language keys (stage_10, stage_20, etc.)
  - Maintained legacy keys for backward compatibility during transition

#### Form Handlers Updated:
- **All POST handlers** now default to stage `10` (Lead) instead of `1`
- Updated files:
  - `public_html/leads/post.php`
  - `public_html/prospects/post.php`
  - `public_html/referrals/post.php`
  - `public_html/contracting/post.php`
  - `public_html/prospecting/post.php`
  - `public_html/admin/leads/post.php`
  - `public_html/admin/leads/get.php`

#### Bridge Manager Updated:
- **`classes/Models/LeadBridgeManager.php`**:
  - Updated stage ranges for prospect migration (50-120)
  - Updated contracting stage checks (130, 140, 150)
  - Fixed project status logic for Closed Won (130)

#### Test Files Updated:
- Updated all test files to use new stage numbering
- Files updated:
  - `scripts/test_leads_list.php`
  - `scripts/test_action_buttons.php`
  - `scripts/test_project_name_column.php`
  - `scripts/debug_button_html.php`

### 4. Module Filtering
**Updated module stage filters:**
- **Leads**: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 140 (Lead through Prospect + Closed Lost)
- **Prospects**: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 150 (Prospect through Contracting)
- **Referrals**: 40 (Referral only)
- **Contracting**: 150 (Contracting only)

### 5. Trigger Stages
**Stages that trigger special actions:**
- **40**: Referral (creates referral record)
- **50**: Prospect (creates prospect record)
- **140**: Closed Lost (triggers follow-up actions)

### 6. Benefits of New System

#### Scalability:
- 10-unit increments allow insertion of new stages without renumbering
- Example: Can add stage 15 (Lead Follow-up) between Lead (10) and Pre-Qualification (20)

#### Logical Flow:
- Closed Won (130) and Closed Lost (140) now come before Contracting (150)
- This reflects the real business process where deals are won/lost before contracting

#### Consistency:
- All stages now use consistent numeric values
- No more string/numeric conversion issues
- Better database performance with integer comparisons

#### Future-Proof:
- Easy to add new stages at any position
- Clear separation between stage categories
- Maintains backward compatibility during transition

## Testing
- Created `scripts/test_stage_migration.php` to verify all components
- All stage mappings, badge classes, and module filters working correctly
- Language translations properly configured

## Backward Compatibility
- Legacy stage language keys maintained in language files
- Old stage numbers still mapped for any remaining references
- Gradual migration approach ensures no data loss

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Run the SQL migration script in phpMyAdmin
2. Test lead creation and stage progression
3. Verify dropdown menus show correct stage options
4. Test module filtering (leads, prospects, referrals, contracting)
5. Verify stage badges display correctly
6. Test stage progression workflows

The migration is complete and ready for production testing!
