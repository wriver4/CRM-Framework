## 🚀 **How to Run Tests**

### **Quick Start:**
```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x run_email_tests.sh

# Run all tests
./run_email_tests.sh

# Run specific test types
./run_email_tests.sh unit           # Unit tests only
./run_email_tests.sh integration    # Integration tests only
./run_email_tests.sh feature        # Feature tests only
./run_email_tests.sh email          # Email processing tests only
./run_email_tests.sh e2e            # End-to-end tests only
./run_email_tests.sh phpunit        # All PHPUnit tests
```

### **Manual Execution:**
```bash
# PHPUnit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=EmailProcessing
php phpunit.phar --testsuite=EmailProcessing  # Remote server

# Playwright tests
npx playwright test email-processing.spec.js
```

## 📊 **Test Metrics & Benchmarks**

### **Performance Targets:**
- **Unit Tests**: < 1 second per test
- **Integration Tests**: < 5 seconds per test  
- **Feature Tests**: < 10 seconds per test
- **E2E Tests**: < 30 seconds per test

### **Coverage Goals:**
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage for core classes
- **Integration Tests**: 100% database operation coverage
- **Feature Tests**: 100% workflow coverage
- **E2E Tests**: 100% user interface coverage

## 🔧 **Test Environment Setup**

### **Prerequisites:**
- ✅ PHP 8.4.8+ with PDO, JSON extensions
- ✅ Database with email processing tables
- ✅ Composer for PHPUnit dependencies
- ✅ Node.js and npm for Playwright tests
- ✅ Web server for E2E testing

### **Configuration Files:**
- `phpunit.xml` - PHPUnit configuration with new test suites
- `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration for E2E tests
- `run_email_tests.sh` - Test runner script

## 🧪 **Test Data Management**

### **Test Isolation:**
- Each test is independent and can run in isolation
- Test data uses identifiable prefixes (`test-`, `integration-`, `workflow-`)
- Automatic cleanup in `tearDown()` methods
- No persistent test data between runs

### **Database Safety:**
- Tests create temporary data during execution
- All test data is cleaned up automatically
- No impact on production data
- Proper transaction handling where applicable

## 🎨 **Test Output Features**

### **Colored Output:**
- 🔵 **Blue**: Informational messages
- 🟢 **Green**: Success messages
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Warning messages
- 🔴 **Red**: Error messages

### **Detailed Reporting:**
- Test execution summaries
- Performance metrics
- Coverage reports
- Failure details with stack traces

## 🔍 **Debugging & Troubleshooting**

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# PHPUnit with verbose output
./vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose --testsuite=EmailProcessing

# Playwright with debug mode
PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test email-processing.spec.js

# Playwright with trace
npx playwright test --trace on email-processing.spec.js
```

### **Common Issues:**
- **Database Connection**: Check credentials in `classes/Core/Database.php`
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `composer install` and `npm install`
- **Test Failures**: Check `logs/php_errors.log` for details
- **Playwright Issues**: Verify base URL and browser installation

## 📈 **Continuous Integration Ready**

### **CI/CD Integration:**
- Tests can be run automatically on code changes
- Multiple output formats (HTML, JSON, JUnit XML)
- Performance monitoring included
- Both PHPUnit and Playwright are CI-friendly

### **Automated Reporting:**
- Test results available in multiple formats
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Performance benchmarks tracked
- Failure notifications with details

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Test Suite Health Indicators:**
- ✅ All tests pass consistently
- ✅ Test execution time within benchmarks
