## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on completing a comprehensive migration from 'last_name' to 'family_name' throughout the CRM codebase, with the explicit requirement to remove all backward compatibility features. The user wanted a clean, consistent implementation using only 'family_name' without any legacy support.

**Initial Context**: The conversation began mid-task, where I had already started updating SQL column references from 'last_name' to 'family_name' in various PHP files. The user specifically requested to continue without backward compatibility, meaning no dual support for both field names.

**Key Changes Implemented**:

1. **Frontend Forms Updated**: Modified HTML forms in `/public_html/leads/new.php` and `/public_html/admin/leads/edit.php` to use `name="family_name"` instead of `name="last_name"`, along with corresponding `id` and `for` attributes.

2. **Form Processing Logic**: Updated all POST processing files to read from `$_POST['family_name']` instead of `$_POST['last_name']`, including:
   - `/public_html/leads/post.php`
   - `/public_html/leads/post_with_contact_integration.php`
   - `/public_html/admin/leads/post.php`

3. **Display Variables**: Changed variable names from `$last_name` to `$family_name` in get/display files:
   - `/public_html/leads/get.php`
   - `/public_html/admin/leads/get.php`
   - Updated corresponding display references in view and delete pages

4. **Language Keys**: Updated language files to use `'lead_family_name'` instead of `'lead_last_name'` for consistency, though kept the display text as "Family Name".

5. **SQL Cleanup**: Fixed duplicate `family_name` entries in INSERT statements in `/classes/Leads.php` that were causing SQL errors.

6. **Comment Cleanup**: Removed all "backward compatibility" and "legacy" comments, replacing them with neutral terms like "Additional fields".

**Technical Approach**: The migration maintained a clear separation between form field names (now `family_name`), database column names (`family_name`), and display variables (`$family_name`). This creates a consistent naming convention throughout the entire stack.

**Issues Resolved**: 
- Fixed duplicate column references in SQL INSERT statements
- Eliminated all `$_POST['last_name']` references
- Removed backward compatibility fallbacks like `$_POST['family_name'] ?? $_POST['last_name']`
- Updated fullname concatenation to use the new field name

**Current Status**: The migration is complete with no remaining 'last_name' references in PHP files. All forms now submit as 'family_name', all processing logic expects 'family_name', and all database operations use the 'family_name' column. The system is now fully consistent without any backward compatibility layers.

**Future Considerations**: Any new forms or API endpoints should use 'family_name' consistently. The database schema should be verified to ensure the 'family_name' column exists and any remaining 'last_name' columns are properly migrated or removed.
