# CRM Framework Information

## Summary
A PHP-based CRM (Customer Relationship Management) framework providing functionality for managing leads, contacts, users, and sales pipelines. **This is NOT a traditional MVC framework** - it follows a direct, procedural approach with object-oriented components. The architecture uses direct file routing (no URL rewriting), database inheritance patterns (all models extend a singleton Database class), and template inclusion rather than dependency injection or modern framework patterns. The application features a comprehensive multilingual system with language arrays stored in `admin/languages/` and a specialized `Helpers` class that generates translation-aware HTML components and form elements. It includes CRUD operations, role-based access control, audit trails, and reporting capabilities. The frontend uses Bootstrap 5, Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, jQuery, DataTables, and Validator.js for a modern user interface.

## Key Architectural Patterns

**Note**: This is **NOT** a traditional MVC framework. It follows a more direct, procedural approach with object-oriented components.

### Architecture Overview
- **Direct File Structure**: Controllers are individual PHP files in `public_html/` directories
- **Class-Based Models**: Business logic classes in `classes/` directory extending `Database`
- **Template System**: Reusable HTML components in `templates/` directory
- **Multilingual Support**: Centralized language files with `Helpers` class integration

### Core Patterns
- **Entity Organization**: Each entity (leads, contacts, users) has its own directory with consistent file naming
- **CRUD Operations**: Standardized `list.php`, `new.php`, `edit.php`, `view.php`, `delete.php` pattern
- **Database Inheritance**: All models extend `classes/Database.php` for connection access
- **Security Layer**: Centralized authentication in `classes/Security.php` and CSRF protection via `classes/Nonce.php`
- **Multilingual Integration**: `Helpers` class provides translation-aware form generation and data handling
- **Routing Variables**: Page-specific variables control conditional resource loading in templates

### File Processing Flow
1. **Request Routing**: Direct file access (e.g., `/leads/list.php`)
2. **Authentication**: Security checks via `Security` class
3. **Routing Variables**: Set page-specific variables for conditional resource loading
4. **Language Loading**: Include appropriate language file from `admin/languages/`
5. **Data Processing**: Use model classes extending `Database`
6. **Template Rendering**: Include template components with language variables
7. **Response**: Direct HTML output with multilingual content

### Unique Characteristics
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Pure PHP with minimal external libraries
- **Direct Database Access**: PDO connections through inheritance rather than dependency injection
- **Template Inclusion**: PHP `include` statements rather than template engines
- **Language Arrays**: Simple PHP arrays for translations rather than complex i18n systems
- **Static Connections**: Singleton database pattern for connection reuse
