# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files that have been replaced or are no longer in active use.

## Leads Archive

The `leads/` directory contains archived lead processing files:

### Files

- **post.php** - Original lead form processing file (archived on replacement)
- **post_with_contact_integration.php** - Enhanced lead processing with contact integration (archived after becoming the new post.php)

### History

These files were archived when the lead processing system was updated to use contact integration as the default behavior. The `post_with_contact_integration.php` file was renamed to `post.php` to replace the original implementation.

## Purpose

This archive serves as a backup and reference for the previous implementations, allowing for:
- Rollback capability if needed
- Reference for understanding changes made
- Historical documentation of system evolution
