### Tools Created

1. **`scripts/simple_migration_cleanup.php`** - Automated cleanup tool
2. **`scripts/migration_status_check.php`** - Check which migrations are applied
3. **`scripts/update_structure_reminder.php`** - Reminds to update structure file
4. **`sql/migrations/_MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.sql`** - Standardized template
5. **`sql/migrations/README.md`** - Quick reference guide

### Next Steps

1. **Review Remaining Files**: Some migrations may be duplicates or no longer needed
2. **Test Application**: Ensure everything works after cleanup
3. **Apply Pending Migrations**: Execute any migrations that haven't been applied yet
4. **Update Structure File**: Don't forget to update `democrm_democrm_structure.sql` after applying migrations

### Future Maintenance

- Use the cleanup script periodically: `php scripts/simple_migration_cleanup.php`
- Always use the migration template for new migrations
- Run the reminder script after each migration execution
- Keep the archive folder for historical reference

### Benefits Achieved

✅ **Cleaner migrations folder** - Reduced from 23 to 16 migration files
✅ **Better organization** - Older versions archived with documentation
✅ **Automated tools** - Scripts to maintain cleanliness going forward
✅ **Clear workflow** - Documented process for future migrations
✅ **Historical preservation** - Archived files remain accessible if needed
✅ **Permanent archive system** - Migrations archived to `/Archive/sql/migrations/`

### Permanent Archive Process

The migration archive has been moved to `/Archive/sql/migrations/` as the permanent location. This provides:

- **Consistent location** - Part of the existing Archive directory structure
- **Historical context** - Alongside other archived project files
- **Easy access** - Archived migrations remain accessible for reference
- **Automated maintenance** - Cleanup script updated to use permanent location

The migrations folder is now much more manageable and has proper tooling for ongoing maintenance!
