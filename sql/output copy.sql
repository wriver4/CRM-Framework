Randy emailed revised proposal to Darin.
3/13/25  Colt emailed updated proposal to Jason. He added a perimeter system & single cabinet.
3/10/25 Visit went well. Pool wont work. Hes ok with size & location of the tank. Randy recommended a partial perimeter system. So a new proposal is necessary.
3/8/25 He texted said he can be available on 3/9 late afternoon.   Randy will stop by & check out the water issue.
3/7/25   texted and emailed, asked if hes available for Randy to stop by on 3/8/25? He answered, not around all weekend. Will get back w/you on the following week.
2/28/25  He texted with another idea to protect his house using his pool pumps , a generator and a backup generator and our batteries so he wont need a water tank.

2/16/25  I texted checking back with you to see if your pool guy came up with a solution to a  gravity source to our cabinet? We know when that happens and we install our system your peace of mind will increase substantially. Let me know.
2/10/25  I texted, asked for updates on pool solutions from his pool guy?           He texted, He said the idea is to put a transformer in the area and then have batteries for the pool pump. Hes having someone quote him on this. Asked if I could give him an idea of what the water tank footprint would be, dimensions. Asked for pictures of them on other peoples properties?                I texted back, Ill look for pictures, also Im not sure where youre going with the transformer & battery idea?  Your home will need 5000 g. of water and it can be in any different sizes to make that work.            He texted back, he thought I was worried about his pool pumps so need a back up battery.           I texted back.  actually Darin, were not concerned about your pool pumps. We just need to tap into one of the pool pipes to gravity feed that water to our cabinets. Once we have that taken care of our system will open up that gate valve to let the water come to our pumps in our cabinets, where our pumps will pump the water to mix with our LTR to spray the roof.
2/7/25   spoke to Darin, likes the system but is trying to figure our where to work the pumps into his surroundings.         When I spoke to Darin on 2/7/25 and he had his pool guy on the phone. I told him our dilemma, he said hell work on that.

He tried calling Kate, no response, I suggested a text, he thought they might be on spring break.             I called Jason, he hasnt called the pool guy, hopefully tomorrow.           I called Jason, he knows a commercial pool guy,he  will give him a call.            I called, her MIL is having second thoughts about tanks. She may be selling the 2nd plot at some point and doesnt want the tanks there. So if we can figure out how to get water from her pool shes open to it.

I called Kate, told her what Jason found out with the pool guy. She wants Jason to screenshot their home & circle the area of tanks placement, which will require more trenching and Jasons figures may change. But shes wanting to move forward with wG so we can order equipment. I ordered a Supply Agreement from Michael. Shes get with her motherinlaw and pay the 50% next week.

Jason did site vist on 2/13/25.  While there and speaking with Kate she wouldve preferred the pool water instead of tanks. Jason said he can do that but she needs to contact her pool guy so he could tap into a line from the pool to bring it down to our cabinet.  So Jason said well create another proposal and get it to you. Jason called me to let Colt know he needs to update the proposal for pool water.  I called Colt requested a revision. He sent it back to Jason for his numbers. I called Jason to let him know hell have the preliminary in 30 min-1 hr.

There are also neighbors that live on either side of them and is concerned about exterior wildfires. In spring when snow melts, it freezes as well and forms glaciers which will slide off the roof & potentially break of anything attached (like rotor heads). We discussed the Tranquility install, theyre @ 6400 ft. and have had no problems. They get 6-8 ft of snow. He said, any elevation over 6000 ft, snow will double every 200 ft.

4/2/25   I called him, he asked if I sent a new proposal. I said no, we were looking into smaller tanks as an option but I  dont have updated info on that. He said the installer wasnt helpful in finding resolution. They were going to get the tank measurements and send them over to me as options.  They had decided on the width and length of space needed.  And he was expecting them to write it down so we didnt have to discuss this.   He didnt want to go out and start over by remeasuring! I couldnt help him because I hadnt received anything from Jason or anyone. He said this issue has sat for weeks with no solution. He wanted the the cost of the crane needed to lift the tank over the house.  He wants the measurements. Hes not happy with things not getting done. Larry said the cabinet cant open on both sides. He said that wouldnt be possible. He said theres 4 things he needs: **1) Do they know the size of the space?  Did they write it down? 2) Find out the measurements and get them to him to see if theyre accurate or not. 3) Do the cabinets need to open up on all 4 sides? On one side it cannot be accessed. Cabinet has to be positioned right up next to the house. 4) It will have to be craned in and there are risks with that. Can it be used carefully and safely without damaging his house?**  I answered what I knew. I spoke to Jason, hes going to speak to Colt & getting updated info on the tanks. Ill follow up when I get the updated proposal and the redesign.

6/4/25  Leon called, left message, emailed, said since last communication via text on 4/29/25 he asked if water could be taken out of Lake Tahoe to eliminate the tanks? You said yes, but its up to the TRPA to make that decision. Have you heard back from them on that question?  Also texted on 5/20/25 asked if the TRPA would not allow water from the lake, could above ground cisterns be an option instead of tanks, they would be easier to hide with bushes. Ive not heard back from you on that question either. Any updated info you can provide would be appreciated.      FU 6/24/25
5/20/25  Leon texted, said knowing the owners dont want water tanks and you dont know yet if TRPA will allow Lake Tahoe water, would the owners allow a cistern to be built above ground and hidden with bushes to provide the water necessary to protect their home and property? Let me know.  FU 6/4/25
4/29/25  Leon called, left message, asked if we could have a discussion about the proposal & prelim design and what the owners are thinking?        She texted, said its not a high priority at the moment. Its a high price and the owner doesnt like the large tanks.       I texted, asked if we could revisit our very first discussion using water from the lake as long as its filtered to be potable?      She texted, yes, but they would need to be certain its allowed by their TRPA     I texted, asked if thats something they could find out?       FU 5/20/25

Well try to hurry it.            She emailed, said She got it but it was a lot of info. Asked if we can just pull water from the lake? Wanted me to ask our team.        I emailed, not an option. Will need to make the tank option work.
2/24/25  She emailed, wanted info. Got reference from Lisa Petty in January but she finally connected and filled out the RFE on 2/24/25. Had lots of questions about our system & how it works. I explained it. They had a proposal from FL but the HOA didnt approve their fire retardant so she wants info on our LTR. I vetted her for $300K for a double & single pump. Also talked about tanks. The HOA is concerned about aesthetics which could affect the tanks. Shell check into that and wanted me to send pictures. I sent some via WeTransfer.
